Jena Spike
--------------

A skeleton project with a sample RDF Schema generator for Snomed using the JENA API. This approach turned out to be too slow, but we reuased the RDF Schema format generated by this code. 

Not part of any normal build of snomed, must be build individually.

Not production code / deliverable.
